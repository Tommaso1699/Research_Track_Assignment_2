Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{scripts/\mbox{\hyperlink{_node___a__1_8py}{Node\+\_\+\+A\+\_\+1.\+py}} \\*This file contains code that implements an action client, allowing the user to set a target (x, y) or to cancel it. In interface we can set the desired position of robot, cancel movement or exit process. We navigate via pressing numbers (for example by pressing button \textquotesingle{}1\textquotesingle{} we navigate to section where we need to insert desired position on x and y axis). After inserting, we can confirm our choice or go back to main menu }{\pageref{_node___a__1_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{scripts/\mbox{\hyperlink{_node___a__2_8py}{Node\+\_\+\+A\+\_\+2.\+py}} \\*This file contains code that publishes the robot position and velocity as a custom message (x,y, vx, vy), by relying on the values published on the topic /odom }{\pageref{_node___a__2_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{scripts/\mbox{\hyperlink{_node___b_8py}{Node\+\_\+\+B.\+py}} \\*This file contains a service node that, when called, prints the number of goals reached and cancelled }{\pageref{_node___b_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{scripts/\mbox{\hyperlink{_node___c_8py}{Node\+\_\+\+C.\+py}} \\*This file contains code that subscribes to the robot’s position and velocity (using the custom message) and prints the distance of the robot from the target and the robot’s average speed }{\pageref{_node___c_8py}}{}
